ProPublica's Cook County Jail Scraper. 
I'm really not sure how this code works, but it says that it scrapes the Cook County Jail website to gather arrestee's data. It takes the inmates' age at arrest, race, gender, height, weight, housing location, bail amount, charges, court date, and a couple other things. I went looking for code that I could potentially use for this class. I'm interested in scraping Boone County's jail inmate data. One thing I'm thinking about is to compare by race the number of people who were arrested and their charges with their same data from casenet. It would be a good way to see how many charges are pursued or dropped by county prosecutors to see if there is a racial disparity. I think there's so many interesting things you could use this for and I'd like to know how to do it.
